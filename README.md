## Introduction

HEINEKEN Vietnam, the leading beer producer in Vietnam, aims to revolutionize brand experience for consumers. From local retail stores to favorite hangout spots with friends, you can easily spot Heineken's advertising materials (banners, posters, LED signs, etc.). These elements contribute to an engaging and memorable experience for customers. However, manually inspecting and evaluating these setups through images is time-consuming and costly for the company.

## Project Overview

As part of HEINEKEN Vietnam's Digital & Technology (D&T) team, our mission is to develop an image analysis tool that can automatically detect the following elements:

1. **Brand Logos**: Detect logos of Heineken, Tiger, Bia Viet, Larue, Bivina, Edelweiss, and Strongbow.
2. **Products**: Recognize beer cases and bottles.
3. **Consumers**: Evaluate the number, activities, and emotions of customers.
4. **Advertising Materials**: Identify posters, banners, and brand advertisements.
5. **Image Context**: Analyze the locationâ€”restaurant, bar, grocery store, or supermarket, etc.

This project leverages advanced AI technologies, including Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Large Language Models (LLMs), to process and analyze data collected from various retail settings. The workflow ensures data accuracy, extracts meaningful features, and generates predictive insights that guide strategic adjustments.

## Workflow

### Data Collection

**Gather Image Data**: The process begins with collecting image data from retail environments such as bars and supermarkets. This data forms the foundation for subsequent analysis and insights.

### Data Review and Correction

**Review and Correct Data**: Collected data is reviewed and corrected to ensure accuracy. This step is crucial to maintain the integrity of the subsequent analysis.

### Feature Extraction and Data Labeling

**Extract Features using OCR**: Utilizing OCR technology, we extract relevant features from the corrected data, converting visual information into structured data.

**Label Data**: Extracted features are then labeled, creating a dataset ready for further analysis and model training.

### Data Analysis and Context Identification

**Check Data Labeling Accuracy**: The accuracy of labeled data is verified. If discrepancies are found, data is sent back for review and correction. Accurate data is crucial for reliable analysis.

**Analyze Data for Key Contexts**: Labeled data is analyzed to identify key contexts and insights, providing a deep understanding of trends and patterns.

### Predictive Modeling and Trend Analysis

**Predict Trends using AI Models**: Advanced AI models predict future trends based on analyzed data, offering foresight into market dynamics and consumer behavior.

### Reporting and Strategic Adjustments

**Generate Reports**: Comprehensive reports are generated, summarizing insights and predictions. These reports guide strategic decision-making.

**Implement Strategic Adjustments**: Insights are used to implement strategic adjustments, optimizing operations and enhancing customer engagement.
